Behavioural Prediction using Tracking, Detection and Recognition
================================================================

Use object tracking, face detection and face recognition to predict behaviour.

Aim is to use the inbuilt OpenCV object tracking algorithms in combination with the OpenCV face recognition algorithms to predict behaviour.   Possibly use face detection to work out when the bounding box may have drifted.

We were originally using CppMT; am initially exploring the inbuilt object tracking algorithms to see if these are good enough.  Otherwise we will (ideally) need to add CppMT to OpenCV
